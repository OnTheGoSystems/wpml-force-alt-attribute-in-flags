# WPML Force alt attribute in flags

## Disclaimer

Users may ask for a feature that we won't or can't add to our plugins for several reasons (low demand or higher priorities).

Sometimes, we create feature plugins that address one or more of these features.

However, OnTheGoSystem cannot ensure support for such plugins unless we decide to merge them into the core plugins.

On the other hand, these plugins are public, and everyone is welcome to contribute.

## Feature

This plugin, once enabled, will always add the alt attribute to all language flags, even when not necessary 
(see [here](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/2013-01-14-alt-text/) when is not necessary).

## Installation

Just copy the whole project in the "plugins" directory of your WordPress site, then activate the plugin from your website's Plugins page.
